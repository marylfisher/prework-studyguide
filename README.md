# Prework Study Guide Web Page

## Description

This web page both documents my learning and shows its real life application. In order to prepare for bootcamp, it was important to gain foundational knowledge through reading and then apply that knowledge. Additionally, it is easy to forget important details with the amount of knowledge new bootcamp students intake in a small amount of time. This Prework Study Guide Web Page acts as a resource for new bootcamp students regarding HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. The main learns from this project include a foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript; application of the foundational knowledge; a base knowledge of using terminal commands to sync with Github; an emphasis on the importance of details within coding, i.e. potential typos; and the importance of debugging.
